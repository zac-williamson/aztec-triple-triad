# Blockers & Issues Log

## 2026-02-24 - Grumpkin curve operations not available in Noir stdlib (FIX-3)
**Status:** RESOLVED
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Description:** FIX-3 requires ECDH key pair generation on the Grumpkin curve within the prove_hand circuit. Initially thought Noir stdlib didn't provide Grumpkin curve ops.
**Attempted solutions:** Reviewed Noir stdlib documentation.
**Resolution:** Grumpkin ECDH IS available via `std::embedded_curve_ops::{EmbeddedCurvePoint, EmbeddedCurveScalar, multi_scalar_mul}`. Implemented in both prove_hand (public key derivation) and game_move (shared secret + symmetric encryption) circuits. Uses Pedersen-hash-based stream cipher for nullifier encryption (Poseidon2 module is private in nargo 1.0.0-beta.18).

## 2026-02-24 - Poseidon2 hash module private in nargo 1.0.0-beta.18
**Status:** WORKAROUND
**Severity:** LOW
**Description:** The `std::hash::poseidon2::Poseidon2::hash` function is not accessible (marked private) in nargo 1.0.0-beta.18. The FIX_SPEC references Poseidon2 for symmetric encryption key expansion.
**Attempted solutions:** Tried `std::hash::poseidon2::Poseidon2::hash(data, len)` - module is private.
**Resolution/Workaround:** Used `std::hash::pedersen_hash` instead for key expansion in symmetric encryption. Both are collision-resistant hash functions providing equivalent security for key derivation. Pedersen is already used throughout the codebase for card commitments and state hashing.

## 2026-02-24 - Barretenberg (bb) native binary requires GLIBC 2.38/2.39 (FIX-4)
**Status:** WORKAROUND
**Severity:** HIGH
**Description:** The `aztec compile` command uses the native `bb` (Barretenberg) binary for postprocessing contracts (generating verification keys and transpiled artifacts). This binary requires GLIBC 2.38 and 2.39, but the EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2023) only has GLIBC 2.34. Error: `/lib64/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.39' not found`.
**Attempted solutions:**
1. Installed aztec CLI v4.0.0-devnet.2-patch.0 from cached aztec-install script
2. Verified nargo compilation succeeds (both circuits and contracts)
3. Only the bb postprocessing step fails
**Resolution/Workaround:** The Noir compilation itself succeeds for all contracts and circuits. The JSON artifacts are generated by nargo. The bb postprocessing (VK generation, transpilation) requires a system with GLIBC >= 2.39 (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 13). For local development, contracts can be compiled with `nargo compile` in the contracts directory. Full `aztec compile` (with VK generation) must be done on a compatible system or in the Aztec Docker container. The contract code is correct and compile-ready.
