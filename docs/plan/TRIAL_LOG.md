# Trial Log — 8-Lane Agent Orchestration

Orchestrator-owned. One entry per sweep/event. Newest at top.

## 2026-06-12 — Launch day

- S0 complete: Vercel token revoked via API (verified 403 post-revocation);
  `account_details_do_not_commit.md` and the dead token file moved to
  `~/.aztec-triad-private/` (700/600 perms).
- Quality bar + merge review gate added to ORCHESTRATION.md (Zac's six criteria:
  flake-masking fallbacks, leaky abstractions, insufficient tests, untracked
  assumptions, stale docs, duplication).
- Trial-start ref for the final integrated review: tag `trial-start` (= testnet at
  launch).
- Lanes launched 16:30: all 8 tmux sessions (`tt-*`) running claude 2.1.176 in
  bypass mode at `e860ec0` (= tag `trial-start`); kickoffs delivered; activity
  verified (lane-7 inventorying root debris, lane-3 reading game-logic tests);
  8 Terminal windows opened for Zac.

## Events

- 17:0x — **lane-7 E1 MERGED** (`ade31c7`, gate passed; first gate run). LICENSE,
  docs/history/ relocation, CLAUDE.md contributor guide. Version-pin clarified:
  nightly string = CLI/sandbox installer tag, `4.2.0-aztecnr-rc.2` = npm/aztec-nr
  tags of the same release (lane 1 to confirm during A1). Gate note: the apparent
  TRIAL_LOG edit in the lane diff was fork-point skew, not a violation.
  Lane 7 proceeding to E2 (Zac pre-queued the instruction in its window).

## Pending handoffs (deliver at each lane's next idle)

- **ALL lanes**: `git rebase testnet` (≥ `ade31c7`) — sane CLAUDE.md, LICENSE,
  docs/history present.
- **lane-2**: remove live SponsoredFPC from `src/aztec/contracts.ts`,
  `hooks/useCardPacks.ts` (+ test) — banned pattern; fold into A2/I. Fix the
  `useGame.ts:433` comment path (report moved to docs/history/).
- **lane-6**: F2 addition — `test-results/.last-run.json` is tracked Playwright
  debris.
- **lane-1**: confirm nightly.20260323 ↔ aztecnr-rc.2 name the same release.
