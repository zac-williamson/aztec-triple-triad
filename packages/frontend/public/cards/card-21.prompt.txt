A rare fantasy trading card portrait featuring "Lilac," a mystical axolotl creature. The central figure is a beautiful soft purple axolotl with delicate lilac-colored gills that shimmer with a faint magical light. Its skin is wet and lustrous, highlighted by dramatic rim lighting that captures warm highlights. Tiny glowing violet particles drift around, adding an ethereal touch. The palette is rich in purples and lavenders, creating a moonlit atmosphere with a mystical aura. The background is a moody swamp with layers of depth and bokeh, providing an enchanting and mysterious setting. Employ chiaroscuro for a dramatic interplay of light and shadow, and tenebrism to have the axolotl emerge from deep shadow with dramatic spotlighting. Sfumato provides soft, smoky transitions between colors and edges, while impasto technique brings textured brushstrokes for dimensionality. Glazing introduces luminous layers of color, enhancing the creature's magical quality. The composition centers the axolotl, filling approximately 65% of the square canvas. Edge-to-edge painting with no border, no frame, no vignette. No text, no words, no letters, no numbers, no watermark, no UI elements.
