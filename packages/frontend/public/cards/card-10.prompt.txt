A fantasy trading card portrait of "Peaches," a soft peach and cream-colored axolotl with blush-orange gills. The creature's round, plump body exudes a content, happy expression as it lounges among peach-colored flowers. The warm sunset palette bathes the scene in gentle, golden light, highlighting the axolotl's wet skin with dramatic rim lighting. The interplay of chiaroscuro creates a dramatic contrast between light and shadow, while sfumato softens the transitions between colors. Impasto techniques bring the axolotl's textured skin to life, and glazing adds a luminous quality to the scene. Peaches is centered, filling approximately 65% of the square canvas, with a moody swamp/mystical atmosphere in the background, featuring depth and bokeh. Edge-to-edge painting with no border, no frame, no vignette. No text, no words, no letters, no numbers, no watermark, no UI elements.
