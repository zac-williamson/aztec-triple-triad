Create a stunning portrait of "Freckles," an uncommon fantasy axolotl creature. The axolotl should be tawny orange with dense clusters of small brown freckle-like spots covering its entire body. Its bright amber gills should exhibit a similar spotted pattern, adding to its distinct appearance. Capture the creature with a playful expression, as it perches elegantly on a vine amidst dappled forest light. Employ chiaroscuro to bring drama with the contrast between illuminated features and shadowy depths. Utilize sfumato for smooth transitions between colors and forms, creating a lifelike, smoky atmosphere. Integrate impasto techniques to give the axolotl's skin texture and dimensionality, while glazing provides a luminous, wet sheen to its body. Highlight the figure emerging from deep shadows, accentuating its form with tenebrism. The background should depict a moody, mystical swamp environment, complete with depth and bokeh effects, enhancing the sense of a magical, yet grounded setting. Dramatic rim lighting should outline the axolotl's contours, catching warm highlights on its wet skin. Edge-to-edge painting with no border, no frame, no vignette. No text, no words, no letters, no numbers, no watermark, no UI elements.
