Capture the essence of the epic "Streamwalker" axolotl creature in a painterly portrait. The creature is a sleek silver-blue axolotl, appearing partially made of flowing water. Streams of luminous water cascade along its body and trail behind it, embodying a fluid mercury-silver palette with an ethereal water elemental energy. Employ chiaroscuro to create a dramatic interplay of light and shadow, highlighting the creature's mystical presence. Use sfumato to soften transitions between colors and edges, blending the axolotl into the mystical atmosphere of the swampy background. Apply impasto with thick, textured brushstrokes to give the creature dimensionality and depth. Utilize glazing to introduce luminous, layered colors, as if light passes through the translucent, wet skin of the axolotl. Embrace tenebrism by having the creature emerge from deep shadow, dramatically spotlighted with warm highlights illuminating the fluid, reflective surface of its skin. Set this fantastical being against a moody swamp backdrop, rich with depth and bokeh, enhancing the mystical aura and impressive presence of the axolotl. The composition should center the creature, filling approximately 65% of the square canvas. Include dramatic rim lighting with warm highlights that catch the creature's wet skin, giving an impression of it being animated by magical forces.
