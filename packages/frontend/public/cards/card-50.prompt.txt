A titanic legendary axolotl, "Lerma," emerges majestically from a mystical swamp, its grandiose form embodying otherworldly beauty and immense primordial power. The creature's ancient, weathered skin is adorned with intricate, glowing green Aztec calendar markings that pulsate with life, casting an ethereal glow across its surroundings. Sacred jade and gold energy emanates from within its form, illuminating the creature from within with mythical radiance. The axolotl's beady eyes glisten with wisdom and a sense of guardianship over its ancient lake domain. 

Chiaroscuro enhances the dramatic presence of "Lerma," with intense contrasts between light and shadow, while sfumato creates soft, smoky transitions along its intricate skin patterns. Impasto technique provides textured brushstrokes, accentuating the axolotl's dimensionality and granting a sense of tangible reality to the sacred markings. Glazing techniques introduce layers of luminous color, allowing the jade-green energy to shimmer as if light itself dances upon the surface of the painting. 

Tenebrism is employed to dramatically spotlight the axolotl, emerging from deep shadows with warm highlights that catch on its moist, shimmering skin, further accentuating its mystical aura. The creature fills approximately 65% of the square canvas, centered within a moody swamp backdrop that conveys depth and mystery, enhanced by a soft bokeh effect in the background to emphasize its legendary status. The overall composition captures an awe-inspiring, mythical essence, enveloping the viewer in the overwhelming magical energy that "Lerma" exudes.
