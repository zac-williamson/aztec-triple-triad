Create a rich, painterly portrait of a fantasy axolotl creature named "Mudwalker." Centered on the canvas, this earthy brown axolotl with tan and ochre spots should fill approximately 65% of the image. It rests on a mossy rock, set beside murky water in a mystical swamp atmosphere with depth and bokeh. Use chiaroscuro to emphasize the interplay of light and shadow, allowing the creature to emerge from deep shadows with dramatic spotlighting. Employ sfumato for soft, smoky transitions between the colors of its skin and the mossy rock, capturing a gentle, sleepy expression. Use impasto to create thick, textured brushstrokes that give dimensionality to the axolotl's moist skin and the moss's rough surface. Apply glazing to achieve luminous, layered color as if light passes through translucent oil paint, enhancing the warm natural tones. Dramatic rim lighting should catch the creature's wet skin with warm highlights, illuminating its simple, earthy realism. The background should convey a moody swamp ambiance without magical effects, highlighting the axolotl's serene connection to its environment. Edge-to-edge painting with no border, no frame, no vignette. No text, no words, no letters, no numbers, no watermark, no UI elements.
