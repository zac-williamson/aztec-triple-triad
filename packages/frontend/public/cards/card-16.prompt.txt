A fantasy trading card portrait of "Marble," an axolotl creature with a striking appearance, filling approximately 65% of a square canvas. The axolotl features swirled patterns of white and deep grey across its smooth, lustrous skin, resembling polished marble stone. Capture its elegant and composed posture, set against a moody swamp with a mystical atmosphere. Employ chiaroscuro to emphasize dramatic interplay of light and shadow, highlighting the axolotl's features. Use sfumato for soft, smoky transitions between colors and edges, creating a seamless blend. Apply impasto with textured brushstrokes to give dimensionality, and glazing with luminous layered color to create depth. Let tenebrism highlight the creature emerging from deep shadow, with a spotlight effect. Render the background with depth and bokeh for a sense of enchanted nature. Add dramatic rim lighting, with warm highlights catching its cool grey tones and silver accents, enhancing its wet skin. Edge-to-edge painting with no border, no frame, no vignette. No text, no words, no letters, no numbers, no watermark, no UI elements.
