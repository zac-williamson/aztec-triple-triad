A fantasy portrait of an axolotl creature named "Starfield," filling 65% of the square canvas, centered in the frame. Its skin is a deep space-black, with cosmic swirls of purple and blue shimmering through a galaxy of tiny stars and nebulae visible within its translucent body. The axolotl's cosmic aura exudes a mystical presence, with dramatic magical effects highlighting its epic rarity. Employ chiaroscuro to create a striking contrast between the creature and the dark, mystical swamp background. Use sfumato for soft, smoky transitions between the stars and nebulae, blending their edges seamlessly with the axolotl's skin. Impasto brushstrokes add textured dimensionality to the creature's wet, glistening surface, while glazing techniques imbue the scene with luminous color as if light passes through translucent oil paint. Tenebrism brings the axolotl to life, emerging from deep shadows with dramatic spotlighting that catches the warm highlights of its cosmic form. The moody swamp background features depth and bokeh, enhancing the creature's otherworldly environment. Dramatic rim lighting accentuates the contours of the axolotl, capturing the mystical interplay of light and shadow on its skin. Edge-to-edge painting with no border, no frame, no vignette. No text, no words, no letters, no numbers, no watermark, no UI elements.
