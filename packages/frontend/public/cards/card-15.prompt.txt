Create a stunning fantasy trading card portrait of an axolotl creature named "Limelight." Center this bright lime-green axolotl with a flashy yellow crest and dramatic fanned-out gills, exuding confidence in a forward-facing pose as if performing on a vibrant stage. Employ chiaroscuro to create a dramatic interplay of light and shadow, highlighting the axolotl's vibrant colors against a moody swamp background. Use sfumato for soft, smoky transitions between the axolotl's lime-green body and its surroundings, adding a mystical aura. Apply impasto with thick, textured brushstrokes to give dimensionality to the creature's skin and gills, ensuring they catch warm highlights. Utilize glazing to layer luminous colors, making the axolotl appear as if illuminated from within, with light passing through its translucent skin. Engage tenebrism, allowing the axolotl to emerge from the deep shadows, spotlighting its distinct features. The background should suggest a mystical atmosphere with depth and bokeh effects, enhancing the creature's stage-like presence. Emphasize the yellow-green palette, capturing the essence of a vibrant performance. Edge-to-edge painting with no border, no frame, no vignette. No text, no words, no letters, no numbers, no watermark, no UI elements.
