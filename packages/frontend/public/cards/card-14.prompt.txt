A fantastical portrait of an uncommon axolotl creature named "Glow Bug," centered and filling 65% of the canvas. This creature has a dark teal hue, with bioluminescent spots along its sides that emit a soft green-yellow glow. The axolotl's wet skin catches the dramatic rim lighting, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow with Caravaggio-style contrast. Apply sfumato for soft transitions between the creature's colors and edges, giving it a dreamlike, smoky quality. Use impasto for thick, textured brushstrokes that enhance the axolotl's dimensionality, reminiscent of Rembrandt. Glazing should be used to create a luminous effect, as if light is passing through translucent layers of color. The creature emerges with tenebrism from the deep shadows of a moody, mystical swamp. The background captures a night scene with a sense of depth and bokeh, filled with fireflies dancing in the misty darkness. Warm highlights from the fireflies catch on the creature's form, enhancing its ethereal presence. Edge-to-edge painting with no border, no frame, no vignette. No text, no words, no letters, no numbers, no watermark, no UI elements.
