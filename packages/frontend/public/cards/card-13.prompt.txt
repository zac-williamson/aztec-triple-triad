A vivid electric-green axolotl creature named "Neon" with bright chartreuse highlights and fluorescent yellow gill fronds, glowing against a dark, mystical swamp background. Capture the axolotl's otherworldly luminescence with dramatic chiaroscuro, highlighting its vibrant neon palette against the enveloping shadows. Employ sfumato to create soft, smoky transitions between its vivid hues and the dark, moody water. Use impasto brushstrokes on its skin to impart texture and dimensionality, mimicking the moist, tactile quality of the creature. Utilize glazing to layer luminous colors, enhancing the illusion of light passing through translucent skin and water. The axolotl should emerge from deep shadows with tenebrism, spotlighting its radiant form amidst the mystical atmosphere. Warm rim lighting catches the wet skin, emphasizing its electric colors as it stands in high contrast against the swamp's murky depths. The backdrop should suggest a swamp with depth, where blurred shapes and bokeh create an ethereal, dreamlike environment. The composition should center the axolotl, filling approximately 65% of the canvas, allowing for an intimate and focused portrait. Edge-to-edge painting with no border, no frame, no vignette.
